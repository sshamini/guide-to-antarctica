    <h2>Scuba Diving and Swimming</h2>
    <p>Scuba diving is another popular activity. Seeing icebergs from below is something that few people on earth have seen and is well worth every cold moment!  If you like your swimming then there is also the option to swim at Deception Bay. Deception Bay is actually a caldera of a volcano which makes the water warmer in this particular area (although still cold!).</p>
    <h2>Wildlife Photography</h2>
    <p>Like the Galapagos Islands, the wildlife in Antarctica are incredibly tame and approachable. If you’re a photographer then you’re sure to get some amazing shots. Inquisitive, photogenic and comical, penguins are the consummate charmers of Antarctica and make everyone’s visit a memorable one. Please see our page on Antarctica photography tips.</p>
    <h2>Kayaking and Zodiac Excursions</h2>
    <p>Kayaking is the most popular Antarctica activity as it allows you to navigate the icebergs into smaller channels of water. Tours also often take their clients on small zodiac boats that take 10-12 people. This is a great way of getting close to seals – including the Leopard Seal!</p>
    <h2>Camping, Skiing and Climbing</h2>
    <p>Other possible activities include trekking, camping, skiing and climbing! These are fairly specialist activities and you will need to make arrangements with your tour operator well in advance.</p>
